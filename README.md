# Digital Water

## Overview

Digital Water is the name given to a partner project between Abhi Kupendiran and Zach Hu. It was originally developed for ECE 342, a course on computer hardware and embedded systems at the University of Toronto. 

It is a handheld water simulator implemented using an OLED to animate the fluid and an accelerometer to grab the device's orientation. The project's core functionality is currently complete, seen in our prototype using the NUCLEO-F446ZE development board. Check it out!

The concept was heavily inspired by this project of Mitxela's: https://mitxela.com/projects/fluid-pendant

## Next Steps

Abhi and I aim to further develop this project by creating a custom PCB and case to bring it from prototype to wearable accessory. 

This document will also later be fleshed out with more technical details.
